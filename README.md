# V1.0
mythicallabs.org V1.0 is public, so here's what's new. 
## Projects Page
Clean projects page with clear list of projects. All projects currently redirect to a development message.

## Development Messages
As the website is still in development, unfinished pages and features redirect to a custom development message, and a way to get back to the previous page or a similar feature.
